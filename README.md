## Overview
The **Cancer Prediction Model** is designed to help identify individuals affected by cancer based on data. Using datasets from Kaggle, the project preprocesses the data, applies machine learning techniques, and builds a highly accurate model to predict cancer diagnosis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize the dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis using visualization techniques.
- Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- High prediction accuracy with an optimized machine learning pipeline.

## Technologies Used
The project is built using the following libraries and tools:
- **Python**
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-prediction.git
